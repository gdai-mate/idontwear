## Project Concepts

### Web Design Inspiration
- Build a static e-commerce website for a clothing company that captures the late 1990s to early 2000s web design aesthetic
- Curate a brutalist design approach inspired by Diesel's hypothetical 2001 web presence
- Design principles:
  * Color palette limited to warm greys, muted earth tones, and deep browns
  * Use system serif fonts (Times New Roman, Georgia) or grungy monospace fonts
  * Implement rigid, lo-fi layout using traditional <table> layouts and inline styles
  * Avoid modern layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid
  * Create a flat design with rough spacing and intentionally overlapping content
  * Use pixelated imagery and textures

### Technical Specifications
- Minimal JavaScript implementation (vanilla JS only)
- No modern web frameworks
- Emphasize nostalgic user experience over technical polish

### Design Elements
- Retro UI components:
  * <marquee> elements
  * <blink> tags
  * Under-construction banners
  * Low-resolution hover effects
- Navigation: centered or left-aligned with underlined text links
- Product listings with:
  * Placeholder product images
  * Pricing information
  * Rudimentary cart system
- Include contact page with fictional contact details
- Home page hero section with vintage web aesthetic

### Design Philosophy
- Create an "ugly" design that is intentionally curated
- Represent an artistic protest against modern web design standards
- Prioritize mood and nostalgic experience
